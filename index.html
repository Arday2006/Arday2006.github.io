<p class="font">Messi was born on June 24, 1987, in Rosario, Argentina. As a young boy, Messi tagged along when his two older brothers played soccer with their friends, unintimidated by the bigger boys.

a Rosario-based club. smaller than most of the kids in his age group, Messi was diagnosed by doctors as suffering from a hormone deficiency that restricted his growth. 
Messi's parents, Jorge and Ceclia, decided on a regimen of nightly growth hormone injections for their son, though it soon proved impossible to pay several hundred dollars per month for the medication. 
  of 13, when Messi was offered the chance to train at soccer powerhouse FC Barcelona's youth academy, La Masia, and have his medical bills covered by the team, Messi's family picked up and moved across the Atlantic to make a new home in Spain. 
Although he was often homesick in his new country, Messi moved quickly through the junior system ranks.<p>
